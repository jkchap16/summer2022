Urban green spaces (UGS) provide many mental and physical health benefits for humans, especially as urban heat islands become a significant problem in cities. Unfortunately, prior research has shown that UGS are primarily distributed in white and high-income neighborhoods. This project attempts to characterize the accessibility of UGS to different racial demographics in New York City using a Multiscale Geographic Weighted Regression (MGWR) analysis. This will make visible the spatial trend of UGS and determine the communities most at risk.
